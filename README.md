Experimental analysis was performed for a vertical axis savonius turbine with helical blades. Post succesful fabrication using GI sheet, a dynamo was used to convert mechanical energy to electrical and parameters such as voltage, RPM and current were recorded. A DC-DC step up booster was used in the circuit to step up the voltage output. A 12V LED strip was successfully illuminated by means of wind energy. My team bagged the best project award for same.
